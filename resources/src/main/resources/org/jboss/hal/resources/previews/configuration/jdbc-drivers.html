<p>Before your application can connect to a data source, your data source vendor's JDBC drivers need to be installed. You can choose between two different ways to install JDBC drivers:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Modules</dt>
    <dd><p>To install a JDBC driver as a module you need to create a file path structure under the
        <code>${build.installDir}/modules</code>, copy the JDBC driver JAR into the
        <code>main/</code> subdirectory and create a <code>module.xml</code> file.</p>
        <p>Once the JDBC driver is available as a module you can use this section to add, modify and remove driver configurations.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Deployments</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>You can deploy JDBC drivers just like any other deployment. This means that you can deploy them across multiple servers in a server group, if you use a managed domain. Any JDBC 4-compliant driver will automatically be recognized and installed into the system by name and version.</p>
        <p>In domain mode drivers deployed as applications will only show up in this section if there are running servers which match the selected profile.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
